# RJL - Runtime JAR Loader
Source code of my old project which allows you to inject Jar-files to Minecraft

## The short history
The project started in late 2020, finished in January 2021. The whole method is like 2-3 years old right now, but the functions and addresses were changing, so i've updated the code for latest 1.19.3 version
